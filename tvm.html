                <figcaption>Vizhinjam Lighthouse <p>
                    Vizhinjam Lighthouse is situated near Kovalam beach in Kerala.[1][2] It started functioning on 30 June 1972. Vizhinjam was a busy seaport in the eighteenth and nineteenth 
                    centuries. Before the current light was installed, there were no lighthouses at this location. A day mark beacon (flag mast) must have been there in 18th century. After 19th century, this port was in a neglected state. 
                    A lighted beacon was constructed in 1925 at nearby Kolachal. Subsequently, a day mark beacon was provided at Vilinjam during 1960.
