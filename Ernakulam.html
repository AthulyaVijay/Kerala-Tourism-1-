                    Though built around 1695 by the Dutch East India Company, David Hall, situated in Fort Kochi, gets its name from one of its later occupants, 
                    David Koder, a Jewish businessman. The Hall, which is now an art gallery, was originally 
                    associated with Hendrik Adriaan van Reed tot Drakestein, renowned Dutch commander better known for his Hortus Malabaricus, a pioneering compilation of the flora of the Malabar Coast.

                    Folklore Museum is one of the famous antique museums in Kerala which is created in Keralan style and showcases a broad variety 
                    of historical and cultural antiques from South India. It's a dream of Annie George who has been collecting rare antiques till her existence and the collections of rare antiques which are
                     displayed now in the museum are just because of her hard work that she did with the help of 62 skilled laborers.
